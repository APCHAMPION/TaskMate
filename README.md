## Tech Stack

**React Native:** For building the mobile application
- **Expo SDK:** Version 51.0.28 for easy development and testing
- **SQLite:** For local data storage
- **Expo-sqlite:** Version 14.0.6 for SQLite integration with Expo


## Usage

Run the app on an Android or iOS device/emulator.
- Use the plus button to add new tasks.
- Use the filter options to view tasks by category or completion status.
- Tap on tasks to edit or mark them as completed.

## Design Choices
- Chose SQLite for local persistence due to its lightweight and fast performance for handling task data.
- Implemented a category-based filtering system to enhance task management.
- Used a simple and clean UI to focus on usability and ease of navigation.
## Challenges Encountered
- **Navigation State Issues:** One challenge was ensuring that task and category data refreshed correctly when navigating to certain screens, such as the edit screen. Initially, the        `fetchTaskData` and `fetchCategories` functions were only called once, causing data inconsistencies when returning to the screen. This was resolved by using the `useFocusEffect` hook from React Navigation, which allows functions to be executed every time the screen is focused, ensuring that the latest data is always displayed.
- **SQLite Integration:** Initial difficulties with setting up SQLite on Expo. Solved by using `expo-sqlite/legacy` library and following documentation carefully.
## Future Enhancements

- **Implement Notifications for Upcoming Tasks:**  
  Add push notifications to remind users of pending or due tasks, helping them stay on track with their schedules.
  
- **Support for Recurring Tasks:**  
  Introduce the ability to set recurring tasks with customizable intervals, making it easier to manage repeating activities.

- **Enhanced UI with Theming Options:**  
  Allow users to personalize the appâ€™s appearance by offering different themes, including light and dark modes.

- **Calendar and Time Integration:**  
  Add a calendar view to visualize tasks by date, and incorporate time settings for tasks, enabling users to set deadlines or reminders directly within the app.
